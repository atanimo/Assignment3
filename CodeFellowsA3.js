/*
(3) Generate a Backbone.js, Ember.js, AND/or Spine.js app that allows a user to create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) users. 
Users should have first name, last name, and email address fields. If you have time, add extra features to this app (be creative) 
and tell us what you did so we donâ€™t miss it. Bonus: deploy this app live somewhere so we can interact with it.


I spent a lot of time researching this one, and I honestly think it is too difficult for me to do with the knowledge base that I have. Reading
about backbone has me feeling confused because I don't know why a lot of pieces of code are present, or what their purpose is.  I may be incorrect, 
but it seems like conceptually some of the code in this program should be similar to that of the previous assignment; such as creating and destroying
things. Although this project is too difficult for me now, I am eager to learn about the skills required to write this program. */
